# Sencept

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.2.4-black?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=%231f1f1e&color=%23f3f4f0)

**Sencept** is a *quite* powerful framework for generating high-quality synthetic data. The name blends "synthesis" and "concept," reflecting the project's focus on conceptualizing and synthesizing realistic datasets for training and evaluating machine learning models. With Sencept, you can create customizable, schema-driven synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios, making it ideal for testing, development, and research.

## ✨ Features

- **Schema-Driven Data Generation**: Define your data structure using a JSON schema, and Sencept will generate synthetic data based on your specifications.
- **Flexible Field Types**: Supports various data types, including strings, numbers, dates, booleans, and more.
- **Conditional Logic**: Generate data based on conditions and dependencies between fields.
- **Unique Values**: Ensure unique values for specific fields like user_id or order_id.
- **CSV Export**: Save generated data to CSV files for easy integration with other tools.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend and adapt the framework to meet your specific needs.
- (🆕) **Weighted Random Choices**: Assign weights to choices for more realistic data distribution.
- (🆕) **Dynamic Operations**: Perform calculations like sums, percentages, and subtractions on generated data.
- (🆕) **Multiple Output Formats**: Save generated data in **CSV**, **JSON**, or **Excel** formats.
- (🆕) **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Easily generate data with customizable options via the command line.

###### **Sencept** is still in active development, and new features are being added regularly. We also had a todo list that you can check out in the **[TODO](docs/TODO.md)** guide; these are the features that are planned to be implemented in the future.

## 🔨 Usage

### 1. Define Your Schema
Create a JSON schema file (e.g., `generate.json`) to define the structure of your synthetic data and place it in the 📂 `schemas` directory. Here's an example schema:

```json
{
    "user_id": {
        "type": "number",
        "unique": true,
        "format": {
            "prefix": "****"
        },
        "length": 6
    },
    "age": {
        "type": "number",
        "range": {
            "min": 18,
            "max": 60
        }
    },
    "payment_method": {
        "type": "string",
        "choices": ["GCash", "Maya", "Credit Card"],
        "weight": {
        "balanced": false,
        "algorithm": "beta"
    }
}
```

For more advanced features like conditional logic, dynamic operations, and dependencies, refer to the **[SCHEMA GUIDE](docs/SCHEMA_GUIDE.md)**.

### 2. Generate Synthetic Data (CLI)

Use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) to generate synthetic data with customizable options:

```bash
python main.py --numrows 1000 --format csv
```

**CLI Options**:

| Options | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--numrows` | Number of rows to generate. | 1000 | Definitely **Yes** | 
| `--format` | Output format (csv, json, excel). | csv | **No** |
| `--output` | Output directory for the generated file. | `data/generated` | **No** |

**Example**:

- To generate 1000 rows, save as CSV, and change its output directory:
```bash
python main.py --numrows 1000 --format csv --output generated/sales
```

❗ NOTE: This will create a new directory named 📂 `generated/sales/` in the root folder.
